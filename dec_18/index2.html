                                to violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade
                                secret, copyright, or patent rights) or to the extent that you believe we have
                                violated or threatened to violate your intellectual property rights. Under such
                                circumstances we or you may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to
                                stop intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret,

                                informal dispute-resolution process described above. Second, you may bring any
                                matter within the jurisdiction of a small claims court or similar court in
                                which you seek less than $10,000 in a small claims court or similar court on an

                                ARBITRATION: You and AGL5 mutually agree to forego the delay and expense of
                                using a court of law and choose instead to benefit from the speedy, economical,
                                and impartial dispute resolution procedure of using binding arbitration for
                                Disputes that arise between You and AGL5 , its related and affiliated

                                officer, or director of AGL5 or any related or affiliated company. Arbitration
                                is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more
                                quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral
                                arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court
                                can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the
                                unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms
                                shall be enforced. You and AGL5 agree that this Dispute Resolution Section is
                                governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and will survive
                                even if these Terms and Conditions terminate. Any revision to or termination of
                                the Terms &amp; Conditions that modify or terminate this Dispute Resolution
                                Section shall not apply to a pending arbitration, to any claim that accrued
                                prior to the modification or termination, or to any claim that the asserting
